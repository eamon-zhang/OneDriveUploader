# LightUploader

MoeClub wrote a [very good version](https://github.com/MoeClub/OneList/tree/master/OneDriveUploader), but unfortunately it's not open source and hasn't been updated in a while. This project is a simple upload tool separate from [DownloadBot](https://github.com/gaowanliang/DownloadBot), designed to be a lightweight way to quickly upload data to various network drives on all platforms.

## Features

- Supports OneDrive Business, Personal (Home) versions, 21vianet (CN) version, Google Drive (Beta).
- Support for uploading files and folders to specified directories, keeping the directory structure as it was before the upload.
- Supports the use of command parameters for external applications.
- Support for customising the upload chunk size.
- Supports multi-threaded uploads (multiple files at the same time).
- Support for dynamically adjusting the number of retries according to the file size.
- Supports skipping the existing files with the same name in the OneDrive.
- Support for real-time monitoring of upload progress via Telegram Bot, for easy monitoring of uploads when using fully automated download scripts.

Note that when a configuration file is used at the same time and the parameters in the configuration file are not the default values, the parameters in the configuration file will be used by default, and when parameters are entered on the command line, the parameters currently entered on the command line will be used and the parameters in the configuration file will be changed. That is, the parameters in the command line take precedence over the parameters in the configuration file and will change the parameters in the configuration file.

## Note

Returns 0 when there is no problem with the upload, which can be used as evidence of whether the upload has failed or not
